Welcome to my blog/wiki/bliki/memex. It is currently formatted in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), built by and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). You can also [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/stevemoser/jekyll-netlify-cms). If you see room for improvement (even just a typo) please use the edit button above and submit a pull request.

#### History

Brief rundown of my blogging past:

1. **Geocities** - My first page
2. **Twitter** - Microblogging!
3. **Tumbler** - So simple, yet little control
4. **Wordpress** - More control and complexity
5. **Jekyll** - Simplicity and control but a little bare
6. **Octopress** - That looks nice... like every other hacker blog
7. **Jekyll generated and hosted on Github Pages** - Editing on Github works but is a pain on mobile and no support for unsafe plugins
8. **Jekyll generated by Travis CI and hosted on Github Pages** - More control but complicated and no HTTPS with custom domains
9. **Jekyll on Gitlab** - It even includes its own CI! Sadly as of this writing custom domains are disabled due to a bug
10. **Jekyll on Netlify** - Simple and one click HTTPS with a custom domain. Plus with Netlify CMS I can edit on mobile.

In the future you can find a step by step guide for setting up a blog/wiki like mine.

#### Starting Point

Here are a few good starting points for exploring content here:

* [Why be findable?](sociology/why-be-findable.md)
* [Syndicated Memex](syndicated-memex.md)

#### Categories

* [Apple Development](apple-dev/README.md)
* [Computing](computing/README.md)
* [Sociology](sociology/README.md)
* [Programming](programming/README.md)

#### Stubs

There may be links to posts with little or no content and that is okay. This allows me to write about things as deep or broad as I want to go and come back and flesh out the in-between pages later. Normally this would lead to a mess with a normal blog but hopefully most people don't consume this site like a normal blog.
